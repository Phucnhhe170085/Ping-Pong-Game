## Introduction

The Ping Pong Arduino Game is a DIY project that allows you to build and play a simple ping pong game using an Arduino microcontroller. The game involves moving a paddle to hit a ball back and forth, with the aim of keeping the ball in play for as long as possible.

## Features

- Simple and fun gameplay
- LED display to show the ball and paddle movement
- Score tracking
- Adjustable game speed
- Easy to build with common electronic components

## Components

To build this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino Uno (or compatible) board
- Breadboard
- LEDs
- Resistors
- Push buttons
- Jumper wires
- Potentiometer (optional, for adjusting game speed)
- Buzzer (optional, for sound effects)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Ping Pong Arduino Game:

1. **Assemble the Circuit:**
   - Connect the LEDs to the Arduino pins to represent the ball and paddles.
   - Connect the push buttons to control the paddles.
   - Optionally, connect a potentiometer to adjust the game speed.
   - Optionally, connect a buzzer for sound effects.

2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Download the Arduino code from this repository.
   - Open the code in the Arduino IDE.
   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino board.

3. **Play the Game:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, the game will start automatically.
   - Use the push buttons to move the paddles and keep the ball in play.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to keep the ball in play by moving the paddle up and down to hit the ball. Each time the ball hits the paddle, your score increases. The game ends when the ball misses the paddle.

### Controls

- **Left Button:** Move the left paddle up
- **Right Button:** Move the right paddle down
- **Potentiometer (if used):** Adjust the game speed

### Scoring

- Each successful hit increases the score by 1.
- The score is displayed on the LED matrix or serial monitor.
